# Granularity System

## Naive form/meaning axis

* Granularity on forms
  * Maximal matching with DeepLex
  * Granularity penalized HMM
* Granularity on meaning
  * Sense vectors
  * BUT, what are granularized meanings on coarse-grained form/token?
  * What are granularized meanings/annotations?

## A function approach

Granularized annotations are a function from sequence of characters to an annotation vectors. This function can be tabularized as human inputs, or learned through supervised learning or reinforced learning (or, a simpler form, contextual bandit).
